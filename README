This is a demo service that works with the Firefox Social API.

Start the server and browse to http://demosocialservice.org:8888
You will see a notification bar allowing you to install the service, install it to continue.

You'll need to run it locally and modify /etc/hosts with whatever hostname you choose.  And of course it's not very social if you're running it on localhost.

Before running the server for the first time, change to the server directory 
and execute:

    npm install

Run the server with:

	NODE_ENV=development node server.js 8888
