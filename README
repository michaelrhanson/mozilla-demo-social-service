This is a demo service that works with the Firefox Social API.

For now, you can enable it by adding this to defaultServices.jsm - you'll need to run it locally and modify /etc/hosts with whatever hostname you choose.  And of course it's not very social if you're running it on localhost.

	    "sidebarURL": "http://demosocialservice.org:8888/sidebar.htm",
	    "URLPrefix": "http://demosocialservice.org:8888"
	}

Before running the server for the first time, change to the server directory 
and execute:

    npm install

Run the server with:

	NODE_ENV=development node server.js 8888
